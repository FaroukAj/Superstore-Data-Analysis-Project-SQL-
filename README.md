# Superstore-Data-Analysis-Project-SQL-
This project provides an in-depth analysis of sales, profits, returns, and customer behavior using the Superstore dataset.  By leveraging SQL queries, we gain insights into key business metrics such as sales trends, regional performance, shipping efficiencies, and customer preferences. The results are intended to inform strategic decisions and improve operational efficiencies.


The analysis uses the "Superstore" dataset, which contains information about sales transactions, customer demographics, shipping details, and product categories. Key columns in the dataset include:

Sales_record: Unique identifier for each transaction

Order_ID: Unique identifier for orders

Order_Date: Date of order placement

Ship_Date: Date of shipment

Ship_Mode: Mode of shipment 

Customer_ID: Unique identifier for customers

Customer_Name: Name of the customer

Segment: Customer segment

Region: Geographic region of the customer

Product_ID: Unique identifier for products

Category: Product category

Sub_Category: Product sub-category

Product_Name: Name of the product

Sales: Revenue from the sale

Quantity: Number of items sold

Profit: Profit earned from the sale

Returns: Information on whether the product was returned

Payment_Mode: Payment method used for the transaction
